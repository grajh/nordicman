# nordicman
Standalone seismological Python tool for reading Nordic event (earthquake) data format. The tool creates an internal database of event objects which can then be filtered by the parameters defined in the Nordic format. Picked phase lines can also be filtered.

More information about the Nordic format can be found [here](http://seis.geus.net/software/seisan/node234.html).

No dependencies.

The files are going to be uploaded soon!
