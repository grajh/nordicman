## readnordic
Python tool for reading and manipulating Nordic data format. Useful methods for earthquake and phase filtering, writing output files, calculting parameters and statistics, adding noise and several more are available. The tool creates an internal database of event objects which can then be filtered by the parameters defined in the Nordic format. Picked phase lines can also be filtered.
