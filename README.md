## nordicman
Python tool for reading and manipulating Nordic and several other seismological event (earthquake) data formats. Useful methods for earthquake and phase filtering, writing output files, calculting parameters and statistics, adding noise and several more are available. The tool creates an internal database of event objects which can then be filtered by the parameters defined in the Nordic format. Picked phase lines can also be filtered.

More information about the Nordic format can be found [here](http://seis.geus.net/software/seisan/node234.html).
